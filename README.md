# venue11pro
Hooks and scripts for Dell Venue 11 Pro tablet.

Collection of my last discoveries.
1)Dell Travel keyboard with extra battery freezes. To fix this I temporarly disconnected battery from board.
2)Made internal microphone working. Look into sound/etc/asound_venue11pro.state. Also this microphone works better when tablet is unplugged or 
plugged and with brightness set to maximum.

TODO.
1)Decribe all other files in repository.
2)There is a bug with random freezes. Even after applying patch for legacy boost. I beleive it's connected with GPU... Compiling world in gentoo 
went well, but tablet could freeze in player and in web browser.
3)Cameras don't work. All of them. Connected with Intel Image Signal Processor. Perhaps...
4)Connected sleep.
5)Bluetooth...
